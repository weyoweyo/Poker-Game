# Poker-Game
A poker-shuffle game created as the final project of IFT1015-Programming1 at the University of Montreal

This program allows us to play the poker game. This solitaire game consists of placing 25 cards 
in a 5 by 5 grid to form poker hands on the 5 rows and 5 columns.
When the player places the 25th card, the game ends and the program displays the final score then restarts a new game.
Before the end of the game the player can move the cards on the grid.
He can also start a new game by clicking a button.

A poker hand is a group of 5 cards. Here are the different poker hands and the associated score:  
Royale Flush: 100 points  
Straight Flush: 75 points  
Four of a Kind: 50 points  
Full House: 25 points  
Flush: 20 points  
Straight: 15 points
